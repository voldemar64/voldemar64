## Spotlight project — COOKie

COOKie is a full‑stack web platform for recipe discovery and meal planning with accurate nutrition data, content moderation, and admin workflows. The MVP uses a modular monolith split (Next.js 14 frontend + ASP.NET Core 8 API), PostgreSQL, Redis, and a managed setup on Yandex Cloud. The project follows an architecture‑first approach with detailed PlantUML API specs, 100+ functional requirements, full‑text search with Russian morphology, JWT + OAuth auth, batch recipe import, responsive UI, and an OpenAPI‑ready REST API.

- Architecture and docs: https://github.com/COOKAITeam/architecture

- Backend (ASP.NET Core 8, PostgreSQL, Redis): https://github.com/COOKAITeam/cookie-backend  

Goals: 15‑week MVP, 250+ curated recipes at launch, 1K users in the first month, scalable to 5K+.
