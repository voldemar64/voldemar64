# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile — Vladimir here, a frontend-leaning full‑stack developer focused on building fast, accessible web apps with clean architecture and measurable product impact.

## About me

- ITMO University, Software Engineering (B.Sc.), 3rd year  
- Building COOKie — a recipe discovery and nutrition platform (MVP)  
- Passionate about performance, DX, and data‑driven UX decisions

## Tech stack

### Core frontend
- TypeScript, React, Next.js 14 (App Router)  
- TailwindCSS, Zustand, TanStack Query  
- Accessibility, SSR/SSG/ISR, bundle optimization

### Backend and data
- C#/.NET 8 (ASP.NET Core, EF Core, LINQ)  
- Node.js/Express (REST), PostgreSQL, Redis  
- Auth: JWT + OAuth (Yandex ID, VK)

### DevOps and tooling
- Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), OpenAPI/Swagger, RFC 7807 errors  
- Yandex Cloud (VM, Object Storage, CDN), Sentry, GA  
- Git (branching, code review, semantic commits)

## Spotlight project — COOKie

COOKie is a web platform for recipe discovery with accurate macro calculations, content moderation, and admin workflows. The MVP uses a monolithic split (Next.js frontend + ASP.NET Core API), PostgreSQL, Redis, and a managed setup on Yandex Cloud. Features include full‑text search with Russian morphology, JWT + OAuth auth, batch recipe import, responsive UI, and an OpenAPI‑first REST API.

- Architecture and docs: https://github.com/COOKAITeam/architecture  
- Frontend (Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Zustand): https://github.com/COOKAITeam/cookie-frontend  
- Backend (ASP.NET Core 8, PostgreSQL, Redis): https://github.com/COOKAITeam/cookie-backend

Target: 15‑week MVP, 250+ curated recipes at launch, 1K users in the first month, scalable to 5K+.

## Selected projects

- File System (C#) — CLI app applying SOLID and GoF patterns for file navigation and operations  
  https://github.com/voldemar64/FileSystem

- Avito‑like marketplace (TS/React/Express/MongoDB) — internship learning project with auth, listings, and tests  
  https://github.com/voldemar64/avito-internship

## What I'm exploring

- Performance budgets, RUM metrics, caching strategies  
- API design quality (idempotency, pagination, error taxonomies)  
- Developer experience automation (linting, type‑safe APIs, CI checks)
